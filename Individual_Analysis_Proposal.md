## 1. What question are you trying to answer?
Which steam game has the most passionate fans based on reviews? 

## 2. Why is this question worth answering? This can be either because it has some personal value to you or because it is a question that others are asking. If it is a question others are asking, then provide an example.
This will measure the "toxicity" of a game's fanbase, which help me select if I want to play a game as that's a big factor in me deciding. 

## 3. What is your hypothesis? Why leads you towards that hypothesis?
I believe counter-strike and Dota2 have the most toxic fans. This is just based off my own experiences of playing these games. 

## 4. What is the primary dataset(s) you will use to answer the question? The dataset(s) must be at least 15GB in their original form when downloaded. Provide links. You may not choose r/place (any year) as your analysis set.
